Project Date: 08/26/2023

This little project was achieved following @TheOdinProject curriculum.

For this project I was asked to create a series of functions that would allow the computer to choose one of the possible options and then play against my own choice.

Struggles:
    I'm, at the moment of the project, still new to coding and new to JavaScript. 
    I struggled a little bit with the syntax of different aspects of the project.
    I didn't know all the reserved words that could serve me for this project.

What I learned:
    I learned how to request input form the user.
    I learned the syntax for a lot of items.
    I learned how to pick a random string from an array.
    I learned how to create a counter to keep track of scores.
    I improved my logic skills by using loops and if-else statements.
